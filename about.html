            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am Tanuja Raju Mohitkar, a third year student in SGBAU University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for software development and data analysis, with experience in languages like Python, Java, and SQL.html,css.

                 I have completed projects that include developing a mobile app for farmer's welfare. I have also been actively involved in technical events like hakathon.
                
                In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on my ability to work collaboratively in teams and communicate effectively with diverse groups. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenges that push my boundaries.
                
                Looking ahead, I hope to secure an internship in software development next summer, where I can apply my skills and gain valuable industry experience. I’m excited about connecting with professionals in the field, so feel free to reach out!</p>
